Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN) — Shares are reacting to a mix of strong Q3 results and pipeline/strategic updates that attracted analyst upgrades, offset by regulatory and product-specific headwinds tied to EYLEA HD manufacturing. Overall, earnings and Dupixent strength supported upside and buy-side price-target raises, while an FDA Complete Response Letter for a pre-filled syringe filing and ongoing EYLEA share pressure are weighing on the stock today.
Positive Sentiment:
Q3 beat and strong commercial/pipeline progress — Regeneron reported Q3 revenue of $3.75B, EPS above estimates, big Dupixent growth, FDA approvals (Libtayo, Evkeeza, Lynozyfic) and other positive trial readouts that reinforce longer-term upside.
