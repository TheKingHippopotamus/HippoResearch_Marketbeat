Apple Inc. (AAPL) is trading higher after a wave of bullish headlines: strong demand for the new iPhone Pro models has revived upgrade momentum, lifting Apple briefly into the $4 trillion market‑cap club and prompting analyst upgrades ahead of fiscal Q4 results due Oct. 30. Investors are cheering better hardware and services traction, but upcoming earnings and the Fed decision this week raise short‑term volatility. Below are the key developments driving the move.
