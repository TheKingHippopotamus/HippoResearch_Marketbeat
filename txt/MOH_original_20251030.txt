Molina Healthcare, Inc. (MOH) is trading lower after a flood of securities‑litigation notices and law‑firm solicitations tied to a class period from Feb. 5, 2025 through July 23, 2025. Multiple firms are asking investors to seek appointment as lead plaintiff (deadline Dec. 2, 2025). That litigation risk — layered on recent operational/earnings weakness and guidance concerns — is likely increasing selling pressure and investor uncertainty.
