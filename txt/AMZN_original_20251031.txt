Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) — Investors are reacting to a mixed set of Q3 results and company actions. Amazon posted a clear beat on revenue and EPS driven by a stronger-than-expected AWS (cloud) quarter and progress on large AI infrastructure projects, but cautious revenue guidance, higher capex and recent mass layoffs are creating intraday selling pressure even as shares rallied in after‑hours trading.
Positive Sentiment:
Q3 earnings beat — Amazon reported $1.95 EPS vs. ~$1.57 consensus and revenue topped estimates; that upside is a primary driver of strength.

Positive Sentiment:
AWS momentum — Cloud revenue grew ~20% (about $33B) — the fastest pace since 2022 — with management citing AI demand, which underpins upside to long‑term AWS margins and growth.

Positive Sentiment:

Neutral Sentiment:
Analyst response is mostly bullish — some firms reiterated buys and raised targets after the beat, supporting a positive medium‑term view.

Neutral Sentiment:
Market wagers (Kalshi) show attention on wording in the upcoming call (e.g., mentions of "Third Party Sellers") — indicator of heightened short‑term event risk/interest.
Markets bet on whether Amazon will mention "Third Party Sellers"
Negative Sentiment:
Cautious outlook: Amazon forecasted quarterly revenue largely below Wall Street estimates, which likely prompted the intraday selloff despite the beat.

Negative Sentiment:
Higher spending and restructuring: Amazon raised full‑year capex guidance (~$125B) for AI/data centers and reported significant severance/layoff actions (14,000 cut this week) — both increase near‑term cash burn and execution risk.

Bottom line for investors: Q3 results and AWS strength are constructive for AMZN's long‑term story, but below‑consensus near‑term guidance, rising capex and restructuring costs explain the intraday weakness; after‑hours strength reflects investors focusing on AWS/AI upside. Monitor guidance details, capex cadence and AWS growth cadence for the next move.
