Mondelez International (MDLZ) — Shares are trading lower after the company’s Q3 release and a weaker-than-expected FY‑2025 outlook. Investors are reacting to softer profit guidance and multiple analyst price‑target cuts amid elevated cocoa and transport costs, while a few analysts and commentators flag longer‑term upside if cocoa deflation arrives.

Bottom line for investors: near‑term downside is driven by guidance and commodity cost pressure (cocoa/transport). Watch management commentary on cost pass‑through, cocoa price trends, and upcoming quarterly cadence for signs of margin stabilization before positioning for a recovery.
