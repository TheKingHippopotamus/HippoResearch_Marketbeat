Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (NYSE: ARE) is trading lower after a string of negative headlines following its Q3 2025 results. Investors reacted to an EPS/affo miss, reduced AFFO/FFO guidance, warnings of deeper losses and analyst downgrades — news that pushed the stock to a new 52-week low on heavy volume. Key drivers are weaker occupancy/net absorption in the life-sciences sector, rising interest costs, and management signaling a tougher outlook for cash flow and dividends.
