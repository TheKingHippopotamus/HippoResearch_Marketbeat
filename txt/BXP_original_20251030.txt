Boston Properties (BXP) — Shares declined today despite a string of mostly constructive operational updates. Management reported a stronger-than-expected Q3 (FFO/FFO per share beat and revenue ahead), raised FY‑2025 FFO guidance sharply, and outlined an active $1.9B disposition plan while leasing momentum reached its best quarterly level since 2019. The selloff appears tied to mixed credit/occupancy signals, refinancing of a troubled Hudson Yards loan, and possible profit‑taking after the guidance upgrade.
Positive Sentiment:
BXP raised FY‑2025 FFO/EPS guidance to $6.89–$6.92 per share, well above prior consensus, and reaffirmed an improved outlook driven by asset sales and leasing momentum.

Negative Sentiment:
Some operating metrics are mixed: occupancy softened and certain GAAP/earnings line items were noted as weaker in select writeups — investors may be weighing near‑term fundamentals vs. long‑term leasing gains.

Negative Sentiment:
Conflicting headlines on GAAP earnings/metrics (some outlets cite misses) plus BXP’s leverage profile and recent refinancing activity may be prompting risk‑off positioning despite the upbeat guidance.
