Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) – Investor News Summary
A CDC advisory panel and the ACIP have recommended Merck’s RSV antibody therapy Enflonsia for infants under 8 months, bolstering Merck’s infectious-disease franchise and reducing reliance on oncology revenues.
Seeking Alpha upgraded MRK to “Buy,” citing an attractive valuation (10× adjusted earnings) and a 4% dividend yield, but flagged heavy dependence on Keytruda (≈50% of sales) and the need for portfolio diversification.
Forbes projects up to 40% upside if Merck successfully expands beyond Keytruda ahead of its 2028 patent cliff, noting ongoing pipeline diversification efforts.
Analysts highlight nearly 20 potential new product launches in Merck’s pipeline as key to navigating the looming loss-of-exclusivity for Keytruda.
Morningstar’s latest key metrics underscore Merck’s solid fundamentals but reinforce concerns over future growth concentration in a few blockbusters.
Merck shares have moved lower amid a broader market rally, as investors took profits following recent gains and weighed near-term pipeline risks.
Overall, positive regulatory developments for Enflonsia are counterbalanced by investor focus on Keytruda’s upcoming patent expiry and the company’s ability to drive growth from new launches.
