Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB) shares are trading higher as investors react to a wave of supportive clinical data on its spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) therapy Spinraza (nusinersen) and upbeat analyst commentary.
Positive DEVOTE Part C and NURTURE study results showed significant motor-function gains in SMA patients on a higher dose nusinersen regimen, with 92% of presymptomatic children walking independently.
Biogen has filed for regulatory approval of the higher-dose Spinraza regimen in the U.S., Europe, Japan and other markets, potentially broadening its addressable patient base.
HC Wainwright reiterated a “Buy” rating with a $187 price target, and RBC analysts forecast a rise in BIIB shares, underscoring bullish sentiment among key brokers.
Biogen is advancing a Phase 3 follow-up program for Spinraza, signaling continued pipeline investment but with final outcomes still pending.
Widespread media coverage (The Pharma Letter, GuruFocus, Seeking Alpha) has spotlighted the same clinical findings, offering broad visibility but few new details.
Analyst questions from Biogen’s Q1 earnings call (via MSN) highlighted both long-term growth drivers and near-term margin pressures without immediate stock catalysts.
Wells Fargo maintained a “Hold” rating on BIIB, reflecting some caution despite the positive clinical newsflow.
