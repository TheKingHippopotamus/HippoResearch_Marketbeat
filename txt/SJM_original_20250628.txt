J.M. Smucker Co. (NYSE: SJM) unveiled a comprehensive plan to eliminate all FD&C synthetic colors from its consumer food products by the end of 2027, with dyes removed from K-12 school foods by the 2026-27 school year. The initiative affects both legacy Smucker brands and recently acquired Hostess products, aligning the company with peers like Nestlé, Conagra, Kraft Heinz and General Mills amid heightened FDA scrutiny. Investors bid shares higher on the clarity around timing and risk reduction.
