Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ: AMGN) shares are trading lower amid mixed mid-stage results for its experimental obesity drug, MariTide. While the therapy showed promising weight-loss efficacy, significant gastrointestinal side effects and high discontinuation rates prompted a revised dosing strategy. Investors and analysts remain divided on the program’s prospects as Phase 3 trials ramp up.
Phase 2 efficacy: MariTide produced up to ~20% average weight loss and significant cardiometabolic improvements in people with obesity and type 2 diabetes, with no new safety signals.
Improved tolerability: Initiating patients on a lower starting dose achieved comparable weight loss to high-dose arms while reducing vomiting and discontinuations.
Pipeline expansion: Amgen is enrolling Phase 3 chronic weight-management studies and plans additional trials in cardiovascular disease, heart failure and obstructive sleep apnea in 2025.
Bullish stance: William Blair reaffirmed its Buy rating, citing promising Phase III prospects for MariTide.
Cantor Fitzgerald reiterated a Neutral rating with a $305 price target (≈9.9% upside).
Citi maintained its Hold rating and $300 objective, highlighting a balanced risk/reward profile.
SWOT analysis notes growth potential in the obesity market but points to competitive pressures and tolerability hurdles.
Investor concern: High discontinuation rates and vomiting in mid‐stage trials disappointed Wall Street.
Sell rating: Bank of America Securities kept a Sell recommendation and lowered its target to $252 over safety and market‐positioning worries.
Competitive risk: Novo Nordisk’s stronger weight-loss drug data have intensified pressure on Amgen’s obesity franchise.
